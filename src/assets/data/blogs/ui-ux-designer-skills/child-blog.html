    <h2> Essential Hard Skills Every UI/UX Designer Needs</h2>
    <div class= "sub-blog-section"> 
        <h3 class="mb-3 h4"> Visual Design and Design Principles : </h3>
        <p>
            Let's be honest—looks matter. But great visual design isn't just about making things pretty; it's about creating interfaces that guide users naturally toward their goals.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-semibold mb-1"> Core visual design skills you needs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Color theory </span> and psychology, knowing which colors evoke trust vs. urgency </li>
            <li> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Typography </span> hierarchy and pairing (making text both readable and engaging)</li>
            <li> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Grid systems </span> and layout principles (creating order from chaos) </li>
            <li> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Brand identity </span> and consistency (making everything feel cohesive) </li>
            <li> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Accessibility </span> in visual design (ensuring everyone can use your designs) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            These skills directly impact user retention and engagement. When users can navigate your interface effortlessly, they're more likely to stick around and convert.

        <h3 class="mb-3 h4">Wireframing and Prototyping Skills </h3>
        <p>
            Think of wireframing as creating a blueprint for your digital product. It's where you map out the structure and functionality without getting distracted by colors or fancy graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prototyping takes it a step further—it's where your wireframes come to life. Users can click buttons, navigate between pages, and get a real feel for how the final product will work.

        <p>
            Interaction design is all about those satisfying moments when users interact with your product. It's the difference between a button that just sits there and one that gives delightful feedback when clicked.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-semibold mb-1"> Key interaction design elements: </p>
        <ul>
