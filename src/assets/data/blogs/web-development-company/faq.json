      "question": "What is the biggest financial risk of not having an Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)?",
      "answer": "Skipping an AMC may seem cost-effective initially, but it exposes businesses to far higher losses from security breaches, downtime, or system failures caused by outdated software. Compared to an annual AMC cost of ₹10,000–₹50,000, recovery from a single incident can be exponentially more expensive."
