      "question": "What is the biggest financial risk of not having an Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)?",
      "answer": "Skipping an AMC may seem cost-effective initially, but it exposes businesses to far higher losses from security breaches, downtime, or system failures caused by outdated software. Compared to an annual AMC cost of ₹10,000–₹50,000, recovery from a single incident can be exponentially more expensive."

      "question": "How many people do I need for card sorting?",
      "answer": "15–20 participants show stable patterns. More than 20, you reach a point of diminishing returns. For closed card sorting, 10–15 may be sufficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a session take?",
      "answer": "30–60 minutes for most studies. With 40–50 cards, plan for 45 minutes. If sessions exceed an hour, you have too many cards."

    {
      "question": "Should I do open or closed card sorting?",
      "answer": "Open: new projects, no existing structure, want unbiased insights. Closed: testing existing structure, validating hypothesis, and fixing constraints. Hybrid: refining problematic existing structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between card sorting and tree testing?",
      "answer": "Card sorting = Users CREATE the structure (generative). Tree testing = Users NAVIGATE existing structure (evaluative). Do card sorting first, then tree testing to validate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my boss disagrees with the results?",
      "answer": "Present information, not opinions. Show similarity matrices, user quotes, and fast usability comparisons. When the stakeholder sees users struggle with their preferred organization vs. succeed with the user-informed structure, the data wins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can card sorting work for mobile apps?",
      "answer": "Yes, but bear in mind mobile constraints: fewer top-level categories—most 5–7, simpler navigation, limited screen space. Card sorting will uncover the ideal organization; adapt it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I do card sorting?",
      "answer": "When: Launching a new product, major redesign, adding significant features, users complain about navigation, and analytics shows problems. Not needed for: Minor updates, small features, cosmetic changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do I do with cards that nobody groups?",
      "answer": "Orphan cards present great insight: They might not be a good fit for your product, need clearer naming, need to be in standalone categories, or are better suited as search-only features."
