        "question": "How is UX writing different from copywriting?",
        "answer": "Copywriting sells; it's marketing copy intended to convince somebody to purchase a product or brand. UX writing guides; it's for assisting existing users who are already in the product with clear, effective text that creates a seamless and frustration-free experience."
