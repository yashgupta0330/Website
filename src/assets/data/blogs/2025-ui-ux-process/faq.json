        "question": "What is the 6-3-1 rule in UI design?",
        "answer": "The 6-3-1 rule is a colour palette guideline for creating visually balanced and appealing interfaces. Use 60% of a dominant neutral colour (backgrounds), 30% of a secondary colour (sections, cards), and 10% of an accent colour (buttons, links, highlights). This creates a visual hierarchy and prevents colour overload while maintaining brand consistency."
